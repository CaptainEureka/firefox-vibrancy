## Firefox Vibrancy

This is an attempt to recreate MacOS' Firefox vibrancy

**NOTE**: This setup is only possible on Linux and I have neither the time or the ability to port this to Windows or MacOS.

#### Dependencies:
- Some form of compositor which supports transparency and blur
  -  `picom-tryone` fork with `kawase-blur` [Repo](https://github.com/tryone144/compton) / [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/compton-tryone-git/)
  -  `compton-tryone` fork with `dual kawase-blur` [Repo](https://github.com/tryone144/compton/tree/feature/dual_kawase) / [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/picom-tryone-git/)
- **OR** if you are using KDE the `force-blur` Kwin script [Repo](https://github.com/esjeon/kwin-forceblur)

You can find my configs for these in my dotfiles repo [here](https://github.com/CaptainEureka/dotfiles)
